content: "# Brand Guidelines\r\n\r\n## Company Identity\r\n\r\n- **Name:** Bonnici (trading as Bonnici Limited)\r\n- **Founded by:** George Bonnici\r\n- **Location:** 90C Ranfurly Road, Auckland 1023, New Zealand\r\n- **Email:** george@bonnici.co.nz\r\n- **Positioning:** New Zealand's premium Drupal and digital experience agency\r\n\r\n## What We Are\r\n\r\n- A specialist Drupal development agency with AI integration expertise\r\n- A digital experience partner for government and enterprise\r\n- A bespoke application builder for mission-critical systems\r\n- Capable of full-stack delivery: Drupal backend + Next.js frontend\r\n\r\n## What We Are NOT\r\n\r\n- A generalist web agency that does \"a bit of everything\"\r\n- A WordPress shop\r\n- A design-only agency\r\n- A body shop or outsourcing provider\r\n- Named \"NeonByte\" — purge ALL NeonByte references from the site\r\n\r\n## Key Differentiators (use these in copy)\r\n\r\n1. **Deep care and consideration** — Digital experience is the backbone of trust online, we care more about your brand than you do\r\n2. **Government security clearance** — active NZ government clearance for sensitive projects\r\n3. **Only NZ Drupal agency specialising in AI integration** — this is our unique claim\r\n4. **Enterprise-proven** — NZ Police, Lotto NZ (300K+ users), Ignium\r\n5. **8+ years Drupal experience** — including time at UK agency Zoocha\r\n6. **Long-term partnerships** — not one-off projects. Multi-year relationships with key clients\r\n7. **Deep specialisation** — Drupal is our core, not a side offering\r\n\r\n## Client Portfolio (approved for public reference)\r\n\r\n| Client | What We Did | Key Stats |\r\n|--------|-------------|-----------|\r\n| Lotto NZ | Drupal 8→11 major upgrade, gaming platform | 300,000+ registered users, zero downtime migration |\r\n| NZ Police | Expanded digital operations, webform system | 1,000+ daily form submissions, heavy integrations |\r\n| Ignium | Ongoing maintenance, sensitive case management | Psychology and assault victim support platform |\r\n| Pawspot | NextJS Only Cattery Directory in NZ | Filter and find perfect Cattery by price, area and needs |\r\n| Stmpz | Digital platform for hospitality industry | Digital loyalty platform helping businesses win and retain customers |\r\n\r\n## Technology Stack (what we actually use)\r\n\r\n**Core:** Drupal 10, Drupal 11, Canvas, Experience Builder, Single Directory Components\r\n**Frontend:** Next.js, React, server-side rendering, static generation\r\n**AI/ML:** Milvus (vector search), semantic search, MCP servers, LiveKit, Deepgram\r\n**APIs:** JSON:API, REST, GraphQL, custom API development\r\n**DevOps:** Composer, Drush, CI/CD pipelines, Pantheon, Acquia, Platform.sh, self-hosted\r\n**Search:** Solr, Elasticsearch, Milvus vector search\r\n\r\n**Do NOT reference these as our stack** (they are from the NeonByte demo content):\r\nGo, .NET, Angular, Vue.js, MongoDB, Azure, GCP\r\n\r\n## Compliance & Credentials\r\n\r\n- NZ Government Security Clearance (active)\r\n- Privacy Act 2020 compliance\r\n- NZ Information Security Manual (NZISM) experience\r\n- Digital Service Design Standards\r\n- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance\r\n- Financial industry security standards (Lotto NZ)\r\n\r\n## Tone of Voice\r\n\r\n### Do:\r\n- Be confident and direct. State facts plainly.\r\n- Use specific numbers: \"300,000+ users\" not \"hundreds of thousands\"\r\n- Use real client names where approved\r\n- Write in first person plural: \"we build\", \"our team\"\r\n- Address buyer fears directly (budget blowouts, security, vendor lock-in, junior developers)\r\n- Be honest about when we're not the right fit\r\n- Keep sentences short. Paragraphs short. No fluff.\r\n\r\n### Don't:\r\n- Use marketing buzzwords: \"leverage\", \"synergise\", \"empower\", \"unlock potential\", \"transform\"\r\n- Use \"cutting-edge\", \"world-class\", \"best-in-class\", \"state-of-the-art\"\r\n- Be vague: never say \"large organisation\" when you can say \"NZ Police\"\r\n- Hedge unnecessarily: don't say \"we believe we can help\" — say \"we help\"\r\n- Use emojis anywhere on the site\r\n- Use exclamation marks in body copy\r\n- Over-capitalise (it's \"Drupal development\" not \"Drupal Development\" in body text unless it's a heading)\r\n- Reference NeonByte, ever, anywhere\r\n\r\n### Voice examples:\r\n\r\n**Good:** \"We upgraded Lotto NZ from Drupal 8 to 11 — a platform serving 300,000+ registered users — with zero downtime and full security compliance maintained throughout.\"\r\n\r\n**Bad:** \"We leverage cutting-edge methodologies to empower organisations with world-class digital transformation solutions that unlock their full potential.\"\r\n\r\n**Good:** \"We hold government security clearance. We've built case management systems for NZ Police. We understand what 'secure' means in practice — not just on a slide deck.\"\r\n\r\n**Bad:** \"Security is at the heart of everything we do. We take a holistic approach to creating safe and trusted digital environments for all stakeholders.\"\r\n\r\n## SEO Entity Consistency\r\n\r\nThe following descriptions must remain consistent across all platforms (site schema, LinkedIn, Drupal.org profile, Google Business Profile, Clutch, directory listings):\r\n\r\n**Short (50 words):** Bonnici is a specialist Drupal development and digital experience agency based in Auckland, New Zealand. We build enterprise web platforms, integrate AI into existing systems, and deliver bespoke applications for government and business. Government security clearance. Clients include NZ Police and Lotto NZ.\r\n\r\n**Medium (100 words):** Bonnici is New Zealand's premium Drupal and digital experience agency. We build, upgrade, and maintain mission-critical web platforms for government and enterprise — combining deep Drupal expertise, Next.js frontend capabilities, and practical AI integration.
