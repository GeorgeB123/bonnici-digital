content: "# Landing Page Rules\r\n\r\n## Page Types and Their Purpose\r\n\r\n### Solution Pages (`/solutions/*`)\r\n**Goal:** Educate → build confidence → generate enquiry\r\n**Audience:** Decision-makers evaluating whether Bonnici can solve their specific problem\r\n**Conversion action:** Contact form submission or consultation booking\r\n\r\n### Industry Pages (`/industries/*`)\r\n**Goal:** Signal sector expertise → qualify the visitor → generate enquiry\r\n**Audience:** Buyers from a specific sector (government, enterprise, NFP) who need to know we understand their world\r\n**Conversion action:** Contact form submission\r\n\r\n### Case Study Pages (`/case-studies/*`)\r\n**Goal:** Provide proof → build trust → support evaluation\r\n**Audience:** Buyers in consideration stage who need evidence we can deliver\r\n**Conversion action:** Contact or view related case studies\r\n\r\n### Educational Pages (`/drupal-nz/*`)\r\n**Goal:** Capture top-of-funnel search → educate → establish authority → drive to solutions\r\n**Audience:** People researching CMS options, not yet in buying mode\r\n**Conversion action:** Read related solution page or contact\r\n\r\n### Blog/Insight Posts (`/insights/*`)\r\n**Goal:** Demonstrate expertise → attract search traffic → build trust → drive to solutions\r\n**Audience:** Technical decision-makers, developers, content strategists\r\n**Conversion action:** Read related solution page or subscribe\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Solution Page Structure (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nEvery solution page MUST follow this structure in this order:\r\n\r\n### 1. Hero Section\r\n- **H1 headline:** Clear, benefit-oriented, under 10 words. No buzzwords.\r\n- **Subhead:** 1-2 sentences. Explains what the service is and who it's for. Include a key proof point.\r\n- **Primary CTA:** \"Talk to us\" or \"Get in touch\" → links to /contact\r\n- **Secondary CTA:** \"See our work\" → links to relevant case study\r\n\r\n### 2. Answer Capsule\r\n- 40-60 word paragraph immediately after the hero.\r\n- This is the GEO extraction target. It must concisely answer \"What does Bonnici do in [this area]?\"\r\n- Include: what we do, who for, a named client, a specific number.\r\n- Wrap in a `<p>` or summary component. No heading above it.\r\n\r\n### 3. Problem/Context Section\r\n- 2-3 paragraphs explaining the problem space.\r\n- Speak to the buyer's pain, not our capabilities.\r\n- Use \"you\" language: \"Your platform needs...\" not \"We provide...\"\r\n\r\n### 4. What We Build / How We Help\r\n- 3-5 subsections with H2 or H3 headings.\r\n- Each subsection: heading + 2-3 sentence description.\r\n- Include specific examples, technologies, or client references where possible.\r\n- This is the meat of the page. Be specific, not generic.\r\n\r\n### 5. Our Services (Specific Deliverables)\r\n- List of concrete things we deliver (not vague capabilities).\r\n- Format as short descriptions, not bullet-point lists.\r\n- Example: \"**New builds** — Greenfield Drupal projects from architecture through launch.\"\r\n\r\n### 6. Social Proof\r\n- At least ONE of: client testimonial, case study reference with metrics, client logo.\r\n- Named testimonials are stronger than anonymous ones.\r\n- Metrics are stronger than adjectives: \"300,000+ users\" beats \"large-scale platform.\"\r\n\r\n### 7. FAQ Section\r\n- 3-5 questions in FAQ format.\r\n- Must use proper FAQ schema markup (FAQPage JSON-LD).\r\n- Questions should match real search queries / AI prompts for this topic.\r\n- Answers should be 40-80 words each — concise and direct.\r\n\r\n### 8. Bottom CTA Section\r\n- Headline: question format, e.g. \"Ready to talk about your Drupal project?\"\r\n- 1 sentence of body copy — reassuring, low-pressure.\r\n- Primary CTA button → /contact\r\n- Optionally: secondary link to a relevant case study.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Industry Page Structure\r\n\r\n### 1. Hero Section\r\n- H1 speaks to the industry, not to us: \"Digital platforms built for the standards government demands\"\r\n- Subhead references compliance/sector-specific requirements\r\n\r\n### 2. Answer Capsule (40-60 words)\r\n\r\n### 3. Why We Understand This Sector\r\n- Reference specific clients and projects in this sector\r\n- Name compliance frameworks, procurement processes, or industry-specific challenges\r\n- This builds \"they get us\" confidence\r\n\r\n### 4. What We Build for This Sector\r\n- 3-4 specific use cases relevant to the industry\r\n- Link to relevant case studies\r\n\r\n### 5. Compliance / Standards Section (if government/regulated)\r\n- Specific frameworks we've worked with\r\n- Our credentials (security clearance, certifications)\r\n\r\n### 6. Case Study Cards\r\n- 2-3 relevant case studies from this sector\r\n\r\n### 7. CTA Section\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Case Study Page Structure\r\n\r\n### 1. Hero\r\n- H1: Outcome-oriented headline (not the client name)\r\n- Client logo\r\n- Tags: technology, sector, service type\r\n\r\n### 2. Overview\r\n- 3-4 sentences: who, what, why it mattered\r\n\r\n### 3. Challenge\r\n- What problem the client faced. Be specific about constraints.\r\n\r\n### 4. Approach\r\n- What we did, how we did it, what technology we used.\r\n- This is where technical readers evaluate our thinking.\r\n\r\n### 5. Results\r\n- Metrics displayed prominently (stat cards: number + label)\r\n- Minimum 3 metrics per case study\r\n- Use real numbers wherever possible\r\n\r\n### 6. Tech Stack Tags\r\n- Visual tags showing technologies used\r\n\r\n### 7. Testimonial (if available)\r\n\r\n### 8. Related Case Studies\r\n- 2 cards linking to other case studies\r\n\r\n### 9. CTA Section\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Educational Page Structure (`/drupal-nz/*`)\r\n\r\n### 1. Hero\r\n- H1 as a question or clear topic statement\r\n- Subhead positioning this as a guide, not a sales page\r\n\r\n### 2. Answer Capsule (40-60 words) — critical for GEO\r\n\r\n### 3. Plain-Language Explanation\r\n- Assume zero prior knowledge\r\n- Use analogies where helpful\r\n- 2-3 paragraphs\r\n\r\n### 4. NZ-Specific Context\r\n- Government adoption, local examples, compliance relevance\r\n- This is what makes this page unique vs generic Drupal content\r\n\r\n### 5. Comparison / Decision Framework (if applicable)\r\n- Use a table for feature comparisons\r\n- Be honest and balanced — credibility > sales\r\n\r\n### 6. FAQ Section (FAQPage schema)\r\n\r\n### 7. Soft CTA\r\n- Links to relevant solution pages and /contact\r\n- Tone: helpful, not pushy. \"If you're evaluating Drupal for your organisation, we're happy to discuss your specific requirements.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Funnel Rules\r\n\r\n### Awareness Stage (top of funnel)\r\n**Pages:** /drupal-nz/*, /insights/* blog posts, /drupal-nz/vs-wordpress\r\n**Goal:** Capture search/AI traffic, educate, establish authority\r\n**CTA:** Read related content → solution page (soft)\r\n**DO NOT:** Hard-sell, mention pricing, push for consultation\r\n**DO:** Provide genuine value, be the best answer to the question, link internally\r\n\r\n### Consideration Stage (mid-funnel)\r\n**Pages:** /solutions/*, /industries/*\r\n**Goal:** Build confidence that Bonnici can solve their specific problem\r\n**CTA:** View case studies, book consultation\r\n**DO NOT:** Be vague, use generic copy, forget social proof\r\n**DO:** Be specific about what we deliver, reference real clients and numbers, address objections\r\n\r\n### Decision Stage (bottom of funnel)\r\n**Pages:** /case-studies/*, /about/team/, /contact\r\n**Goal:** Provide proof, build trust, remove final objections, convert\r\n**CTA:** Get in touch, request a quote\r\n**DO NOT:** Introduce new concepts, be generic about results\r\n**DO:** Show specific outcomes, name clients, include testimonials, make contact frictionless\r\n\r\n### Cross-linking Rules\r\n- Every awareness page links to at least 1 consideration page\r\n- Every consideration page links to at least 2 decision pages (case studies)\r\n- Every decision page links back to the relevant consideration page and to /contact\r\n- No dead ends. Every page has a clear \"next step.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## CTA Rules\r\n\r\n### Primary CTA button:\r\n- Text: \"Talk to us\", \"Get in touch\", or \"Book a consultation\"\r\n- Links to: /contact\r\n- Colour: primary brand colour, high contrast\r\n- One per section maximum\r\n\r\n### Secondary CTA:\r\n- Text: \"See our work\", \"Read the case study\", \"Explore solutions\"\r\n- Links to: relevant internal page\r\n- Style: text link with arrow, or ghost button\r\n\r\n### DO NOT use:\r\n- \"Book a Demo\" (we don't do demos — we do consultations)\r\n- \"Learn More\" (vague — specify what they'll learn)\r\n- \"Submit\" (vague and passive)\r\n- \"Click Here\" (never)\r\n- Multiple competing CTAs in the same section\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Content Quality Rules\r\n\r\n1. **Every page must have a unique H1.** No two pages share the same H1.\r\n2. **Every page must have a unique title tag** under 60 characters with the primary keyword front-loaded.\r\n3. **Every page must have a unique meta description** under 155 characters that includes a value proposition.\r\n4. **No page should be under 400 words.** Solution pages should target 800-1200 words. Educational pages can go to 1500-2000 words.\r\n5. **Every page must include at least one internal link** to a solution page and one to a case study.\r\n6. **Stats must be specific.** \"300,000+ users\" not \"hundreds of thousands.\" \"1,000+ daily submissions\" not \"thousands of submissions.\"\r\n7. **No placeholder content.** If real content doesn't exist yet, leave the field empty rather than using lorem ipsum or demo text.\r\n8. **Author attribution:** Use \"George Bonnici\" for insights/blog posts. Solution pages and case studies should NOT show an author or date — they are evergreen.\r\n9. **Images must have descriptive alt text** that describes what the image shows, not just the client name.\r\n10. **No orphan pages.** Every page must be reachable within 3 clicks from the homepage."
